# Biofuels
I will upload some simple R code and data to reproduce the key results of the  paper [Efficiency of second-generation biofuel crop subsidy schemes: Spatial heterogeneity and policy design](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364032116305391)

A short summary of the paper can be found on the [Spatial Economics weblog](http://spatialeconomics.nl/en/biofuel-subsidies-can-be-allocated-more-efficiently/)
